# Rholang Programming Language Documentation

Official documentation site for Rholang, the reflective higher-order process calculus programming language designed for blockchain and distributed computing applications.

## About Rholang

Rholang is built on the latest research in concurrent languages, based on the reflective higher-order calculus (rho-calculus) rather than the traditional lambda calculus. This foundation enables:

- **Complete Asynchronous Language**: Built-in concurrency primitives
- **Type-Safe Runtime**: RSpace++ execution environment implemented in Rust
- **Blockchain Integration**: Native support for F1r3fly blockchain platform
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical foundations with OSLF (Operational Semantics in Logical Form) ensure correctness
