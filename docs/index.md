# Development

Nodes are the basis for the RChain network. The network layer is the lowest level component in the architecture that will eventually support RChain's large-scale blockchain operations. Pre-release versions of RNode are available for users to explore. More information about the roadmap, key milestones and release plans is available at [https://developer.rchain.coop](https://developer.rchain.coop).

## Who is this guide for?

This document is a quick start guide for users to install and run the software for the purpose of evaluating Rholang and/or using the RChain public mainnet. Detailed information about the software for users and developers is available on [https://github.com/rchain/rchain](https://github.com/rchain/rchain).
